                            <p>If you were hoping to see the iPhone 7 at WWDC 2016 on June 13, chances are, you will get
                                disappointed. In fact, industry insiders hint that the Worldwide Developers Conference
                                will adhere to its original purpose and stick to software and software alone. This
                                means, most-likely leaving the iPhone announcements on their usual September schedule,
                                but also probably skipping on any new MacBook Pro with an OLED touch display above the
                                keyboard, that has been floating around in the rumor mill.</p>
                            <p>However, this definitely doesn't mean that there are no new announcements to get excited
                                about. IOS 10 should make its official debut at the venue and so should other big
                                software updates across the entire Apple device ecosystem. The new mobile OS promises
                                another round of UI refinements, with the Apple Music app, likely getting a major
                                redesign for a bolder, yet more simplistic look, as the company puts it.</p>
                            <p>Another popular rumor hints at Apple Pay support for web browsers, so people can make
                                purchases through Safari, as well as integration into iMessage for money transfers. </p>

                        Microsoft has announced a new watch face for Android Wear. The watch face comes as part of the
                        Outlook app and should increase the utility of your Android Wear device if you're an Outlook
                        user. One of the features of the new watch face is that marks the edges of the watch dial
                        corresponding to events in your calendar.
